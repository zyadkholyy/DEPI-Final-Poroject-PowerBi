# DEPI-Final-Poroject-PowerBi
Proudly sharing our graduation project for the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI! Together with my amazing team, SSAMZ, we built a powerful dashboard that offers key insights into orders, returns, sales, and product performance—all aimed at helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

What Our Dashboard Delivers:
📊 Total Orders, Returns, and Profit Margins
📍 Sales Targets by Product Category and Area
🌍 Geographical Breakdown of Orders and Returns
🎨 Product Performance by Size, Color, and Type

Key Features:
Actionable Insights: Combines data on orders and returns to optimize strategies.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-read charts, graphs, and maps for quick interpretation.
Detailed Product & Area Analysis: Focuses on product categories and geographic performance.
Enhanced Returns Management: Tracks returns to improve customer service and inventory.

This project was a team effort, and I couldn't be prouder of what we achieved together! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback. 😊
